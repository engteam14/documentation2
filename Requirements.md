## Requirements


# Elicitation of requirements



1. The provided product brief indicated the overall goals and intentions of the finished product and contained general descriptions of its desired functionality
2. Group brainstorming session was held to compare our interpretations of the brief and to raise a list of questions to address to the customer
3. In a group meeting with the customer, answers to the questions and any other customer comments were detailed in informal meeting notes.
4. Recorded info was formalised as a set of user requirements.
5. User requirements were distilled down into more specific functional and non-functional requirements.
    1. Functional requirements detailed concrete, specific functionality and capabilities of the product as related to its software implementation.
    2. Non-functional requirements captured the performative characteristics of the completed product as a whole which could be perceived by the user or tester.
6. Resulting functional and non-functional requirements were closely evaluated for possible risks to their implementation; these were detailed within the risk register.


# Research into requirement specification and presentation



* IEEE requirements engineering document<sup>1</sup>:
    * Provided comprehensive information on all aspects of requirement elicitation and presentation, although sections 5.1-5.2.8 and 6.1-6.6.3 were most helpful
    * Contained robust justification for the need for requirements and their role in the overall software lifecycle process
    * Informed our choice of specific language, standardised subjects and verbs (user, shall, etc.), the choice of imperative tone, and justifications for these
    * Ultimately, aimed at larger, more critical projects than ours
* ENG1 lecture on requirements engineering:
    * Provided an excellent overview of the motivations for requirements engineering and a lucid overview of this process
    * Introduced the user/functional/non-functional requirements methodology which proved an excellent fit for our scope of project (versus lifecycle-based requirement methodology in the IEEE document)
    * Demonstrated requirements tables as a tool for writing down and detailing requirements

    Informed by these resources, we chose a tabular format for implementing for the requirements register, allowing us to easily add additional metadata to individual rows as extra columns and permitting a quick, comprehensive overview of the entire register. All rows were labeled with unique identifiers, permitting cross-referencing between user and


    (non-)functional requirements, as well as with other sections of project documentation, such as the risk register and architecture specs.
